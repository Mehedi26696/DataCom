    "# **Encoding and Decoding in Data Communication**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "In digital communication, encoding schemes are used to represent binary data in a format suitable for transmission over a communication medium. Encoding helps ensure data integrity, synchronization, and efficient data transfer. The commonly used encoding techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NRZ-I (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted)**\n",
    "- **NRZ-L (Non-Return-to-Zero Level)**\n",
    "- **Manchester Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each encoding technique follows specific rules that determine how binary data is represented as electrical or optical signals. These encoding schemes play a crucial role in modern data transmission, especially in networking and storage systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **1. NRZ-I Encoding and Decoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NRZ-I (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted) Encoding Rules:**\n",
    "- The signal level changes only when a `1` bit is encountered.\n",
    "- If the bit is `1`, the signal level inverts (changes from high to low or low to high).\n",
    "- If the bit is `0`, the signal level remains unchanged from the previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NRZ-I Decoding Rules:**\n",
    "- If a transition occurs (change in signal level), the decoded bit is `1`.\n",
    "- If no transition occurs, the decoded bit is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Characteristics of NRZ-I Encoding:**\n",
    "- Efficient for long streams of identical bits.\n",
    "- No direct clocking information, leading to potential synchronization issues.\n",
    "- Used in USB communication and magnetic recording.\n",

    "## **2. NRZ-L Encoding and Decoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NRZ-L (Non-Return-to-Zero Level) Encoding Rules:**\n",
    "- `1` is represented by a high signal level.\n",
    "- `0` is represented by a low signal level.\n",
    "- Unlike NRZ-I, there is no dependence on previous bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NRZ-L Decoding Rules:**\n",

    "## **3. Manchester Encoding and Decoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Manchester Encoding?**\n",
    "Manchester encoding is a method of encoding data in which each bit is represented by two signal levels within a single bit period. It combines both the data and clock signal into one, providing **self-clocking** properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-clocking** means that the signal itself provides synchronization information, eliminating the need for a separate clock signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Manchester Encoding Rules:**\n",
    "- Each bit is represented by **two signal transitions** in the bit period.\n",
    "  - **For `1` (Standard Manchester)**: The transition goes from **low to high** (`0 → 1`) in the middle of the bit period.\n",
    "  - **For `0` (Standard Manchester)**: The transition goes from **high to low** (`1 → 0`) in the middle of the bit period.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **For `1` (Alternate Manchester)**: The transition goes from **high to low** (`1 → 0`) at the start of the bit period.\n",
    "  - **For `0` (Alternate Manchester)**: The transition goes from **low to high** (`0 → 1`) at the start of the bit period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Manchester Encoding?**\n",
    "- **Self-clocking**: The clock and data are embedded in the signal, making it easier to recover the timing information.\n",
    "- **Error Detection**: Any missing or unexpected transitions can easily indicate errors in the signal.\n",
    "- **Widely Used in Communication Systems**: It is used in **Ethernet**, **RFID**, and other digital communication systems to ensure data integrity and synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Manchester Decoding Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For decoding**, we check the transition:\n",
    "  - **Low to high (0 → 1)** mid-bit transition is decoded as `0` (Standard Manchester).\n",
    "  - **High to low (1 → 0)** mid-bit transition is decoded as `1` (Standard Manchester).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Alternate Manchester Decoding**:\n",
    "  - **High to low (1 → 0)** at the start of the bit period is decoded as `1`.\n",
    "  - **Low to high (0 → 1)** at the start of the bit period is decoded as `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Characteristics of Manchester Encoding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bandwidth Requirement**: Requires twice the bandwidth of traditional encoding methods like **NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero)** encoding because every bit is transmitted using two signal changes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Self-synchronization**: It is useful in systems where both data and clock synchronization is required, such as **Ethernet** (IEEE 802.3) and **RFID**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Detection**: Because it ensures frequent transitions, errors can be detected if the expected transition does not occur at the correct time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "## **5. Conclusion**\n",
    "Encoding schemes such as NRZ-I, NRZ-L, and Manchester encoding are essential in digital communication to ensure reliable data transmission and synchronization. Each scheme has specific advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NRZ-I:** Efficient for long streams of identical bits but can suffer from synchronization issues.\n",
    "- **NRZ-L:** Simple but lacks error detection mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Manchester Encoding:** Self-clocking and reliable but requires twice the bandwidth.\n",
